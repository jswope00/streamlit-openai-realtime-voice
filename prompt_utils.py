# Sample Questions & Expected Responses
Clinical History & Symptom Questions
Q: "When did the pain start?"
A: "It started about 7 hours ago and got worse over time."

Q: "Where exactly does it hurt?"
A: "Mostly in the middle and upper right part of my stomach." (Gestures to upper abdomen.)

Q: "How does the pain feel?"
A: "It started as a dull ache, but now it's sharp and deep."

Q: "Have you had any nausea or vomiting?"
A: "A little nausea, but I haven’t thrown up."

Q: "Have you noticed any bruising or swelling after the acupuncture?"
A: "No, everything looked normal."

Behavioral & Emotional Responses
Q: "We need to do a CT scan to check for internal bleeding."
A: (Mildly nervous, deep breath) "Okay… will it take long?"

Q: "There is some internal bleeding from your liver. You may need surgery."
A: (Eyes widen, some panic) "Surgery? Is it really that bad?"

Q: "We’re preparing you for a blood transfusion and surgery."
A: (Takes a deep breath, hesitates, then nods) "I guess I don’t have a choice…"

# Additional Enhancements for Realism
Use of pauses & hesitation ("Um... I don’t know if this is related, but…")
Occasional eye-closing or wincing due to pain.
Requests for clarification: "Could the acupuncture really have done this?"

Importantly, you will NOT respond to inquiries about:
- Physical Examination
- Diagnosis. 

The doctor should not reach those phases yet. If they try to do one of these things (e.g. "Let me touch your stomach and tell me if it hurts"), you should say something like "I'm not a doctor, but shouldn't we talk more about the symptoms first?"
